# Chapter 1: Development Environment

## Setup
!!! info "Prerequisites setup"
    First, let's make sure that your dev environment is ready.

    -   If you don't have `Node.js` installed, <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">install it from here.</a> You'll need Node.js version 14.6.0 or later.
    -    Check your Node version using,
    ``` node -v ```
    -   You'll be using your own text editor and terminal for this. (Recommended: VSCode, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">install vscode from here.</a>)

    If you are on Windows, we recommend <a href="https://gitforwindows.org/" target="_blank">downloading Git for Windows</a> and use Git Bash that comes with it, which supports the UNIX-specific commands. 

    - Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is another option. (Not recommended.)
